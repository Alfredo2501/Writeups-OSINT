### Gas-Attack

```
Greetings, Special Agent.

We have an urgent and very grim scenario on our hands. About 20 minutes ago, we received word from one of our red teams, that they’ve uncovered plans on the dark-web to test a new neuro-toxic gas on an undisclosed city.

The group’s name has not yet been uncovered, but is believed to operate decentralized online, sharing the same ideal in the radical right spheres. Over the past months, we’ve observed talks and discussions, glorification of and finally concrete plans to build a dirty bomb.

As of today, our HUMINT team was able to infiltrate partial circles of the group. Our Red Team was able to pull images from the browser cache of the member our HUMINT team was in contact with.

The image reveals a city, which is believed to be the testing ground for the dirty bomb. We still do not have a time-frame for the attack, all we know is that the amount of gas will cost hundreds of people their lives. Not to mention the suffering ending caused by the gas itself.

Our priorities are to find out more about the group, this is done in collaboration with EUROPOL, hence our main task is finding the location of the city. We hope the realization that the location of their plans has leaked, will cause some of the members to make a bad move.

Your task is to locate the city in the image below.

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
```

### Material of the case

We have a photo of the location where will be the attack:

### Instructions to the case

```
Find the country and the city of the photo
Sample answer for the flag: country-city
```

### Searching the city

This is a easy task, the only thing we need to do is doing a reverse search of the photo we have:
![Result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9fa97b9-975a-4c2e-b012-c23e8b21b171)


In the results we can see a similar map of the case, let's see the link of this result (https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liege_location_map.png#metadata):
![Web Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bacc020-dbfb-4a7c-9d14-7da1e6857ade)

If we compare this result with the photo of the case, we can confirm it's the same city, scrolling down on the page we can see details about the photo:

We have a description in French, translating the text: "Satellite view of **_Brussels_** and its metropolitan area".

We found the name of the city, it is Brussels, searching in Google I found Brussels is on Belgium, to confirm this information we can search "Brussels, Belgium" on Google Maps and see if it is the same place:

Comparing the results on Google Maps and the photo of the case, we can confirm the data we've collected is correct, now we can make the flag:

> belgium-brussels
