In this case, we have the next message:

### Friendly-Fire

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

Our friends over at the South Africa National Defense Force have reached out for help. Recently, one of their patrols in the north of their country, came under fire from an armored vehicle. At first they thought this to be friendly fire, however no other units were in the area.

They sent a drone to inspect the vehicle and managed to take a photo, before being forced to retreat. Six out of the twenty-four strong platoon were injured, all survived after being evacuated by helicopter.

As they are unfamiliar with the model of the tank, which has since vanished. Therefor they call for our help in identifying the vehicle. That is where you come in, identify the tank so we can track the origins and maybe get further in this investigation.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
```

### Materials

The case gave us only a photo from the tank to search and a few instructions:

### Instructions

```
Find the model and country of origin of the tank
Sample answer for the flag: indonesia-cougar-mk-8c
```

### OSINT to the tank
To search information about the image, I do a reverse search image and I found the next information: 
"**_Merkava_**
Tank
A combination main battle tank and armored personnel carrier, designed and manufactured in **_Israel_**. The first production tank, Merkava Mk.1, was produced in 1979. The latest modification of the tank is the Merkava Barak, introduced in 2023."

We have a name and the origin country, now we have to search more information about the model and their origin country.

In the next link I found a lot of information about the tank: _https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava_
and looking into the models available, I found many coincidences with the model **_MK IVm_**

Now we have all the data we need, we just have to make the flag with the data:
*israel-merkava-mk-4m*
