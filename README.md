# Writeups-OSINT
A collection of OSINT CTF that I do to practice.

OSINT (Open Source INTelligence) It is a set of techniques and tools used to collect public information, analyze data and relate it to turn it into useful knowledge.


With the OSINT we can:
* Search information about persons and business (Names, address, contact information, relationship, social media, documents, etc.)
* Know their reputation on Internet or real life.
* Identify and prevent possible threats in military field or national security.
* Collect data for detective purpose.
* Do a pentesting recognition (Domains, subdomains, IP's, hosts, DNS, leaked data, etc.)
* Do audits and validate information about a person or business.

In many cases, the success will depend on our results and the way we use the data and tools, this is a technique that requires a lot of patience and concentration to collect good results.
